# Claude Code Guidelines

## Build Requirements

**IMPORTANT**: When making changes to the codebase, ensure all packages compile successfully:

- `apps/web` - Web application must compile without errors
- `apps/desktop` - Desktop application must compile without errors
- All workspace packages must build successfully

Always run `pnpm build` or `pnpm typecheck` to verify changes before committing.

## Database Migrations (apps/web)

When encountering database schema errors like "column X does not exist", run database migrations:

```bash
cd apps/web && pnpm db:push
```

This command requires **manual interaction** - it will prompt you to confirm schema changes.

Available drizzle-kit commands:
- `pnpm db:push` - Push schema changes to database (interactive)
- `pnpm db:generate` - Generate migration files
- `pnpm db:migrate` - Run migrations
- `pnpm db:studio` - Open Drizzle Studio for database inspection

Migration files are stored in: `apps/web/lib/db/migrations/`

## Translation Guidelines

When translating to Chinese (zh-CN):

| English | Chinese | Notes |
|---------|---------|-------|
| agent | 智能体 | Not "代理" |
